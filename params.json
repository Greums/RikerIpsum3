Taken from random samplings of dialog spoken by Commander William Riker in Star Trek: The Next Generation.\r\n\r\nThis project was inspired by the many other \"lorem ipsum\" type generators out there that aim to use real English rather than jibberish.\r\n\r\nInstallation is easy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install rikeripsum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen launch a python shell, and try it out: \r\n```\r\n>>> rikeripsum.generate_paragraph()\r\n\"Uh... Wil, sir. It matches my mood. Empty. Love to stay in -- but not with these cards. Riker to Enterprise -- do you read? And your position in this, Captain? Hold it, Aaron! Hypothetically speaking. I haven't. I am simply trying to get you to understand. The Bynars!\"\r\n>>> # or we could just generate a single sentence\r\n>>> rikeripsum.generate_sentence()\r\n'Yes, sir.'\r\n>>> # or we could request a sentence with six words\r\n>>> rikeripsum.generate_sentence(word_count=6)\r\n\"That phaser's set to kill, Captain.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact me at http://www.bugben.com.
